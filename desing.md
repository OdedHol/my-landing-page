Design Analysis & Recommendations
After reviewing both sites, I've identified key design patterns from Salt & Wind that would elevate your landing page while keeping your beautiful terracotta and gold color scheme. Here are my recommendations:
Key Design Differences:
1. Typography & Text Hierarchy
Salt & Wind uses:
Larger, more impactful hero headlines with bold weight
Cleaner, more generous whitespace around text
Better text hierarchy with clear distinction between sections
Stronger emphasis on key phrases (bolded inline text for impact)
2. Layout & Structure
Salt & Wind features:
Two-column layouts with images beside text (not just centered content)
Full-width colored sections that create visual rhythm (like their teal "Who Travels With Us" section)
Strategic use of background colors to separate sections
Content blocks with underlined headings that link to deeper pages
3. Visual Elements
Large, high-quality lifestyle photography integrated throughout
Logo badges/trust signals (featured in publications)
More editorial-style image placements (not just decorative blobs)
Stronger visual breaks between sections
4. Content Presentation
Storytelling approach - more narrative, benefit-driven copy
Client testimonials with longer quotes and more context
Process/steps section showing the journey visually
Specific traveler personas (Couples, Families, Friends, Food Lovers)
Specific Recommendations for Your Site:
Priority 1: Add Rich Visual Content
Add a hero background image or large lifestyle photo showing dining in Tel Aviv
Create a two-column section with a large photo next to your "Why Choose Syd&Eats" content
Add a lifestyle photo to your testimonials section
Include photos in your features cards or create a visual process section
Priority 2: Create Visual Rhythm with Background Colors
Use your existing color palette to create distinct sections:
Keep warm white background for hero
Use your terracotta color (#c45536) for a full-width section (like "Who We Serve" with white text)
Use your gold-light (#f5e5d3) for alternating sections
Add your surface color variations between sections
Priority 3: Enhance Typography & Content
Add inline bold emphasis to key phrases in your copy
Create a "How It Works" section with 3 steps (like Salt & Wind's Step 1→2→3)
Expand your benefits section with more detailed descriptions
Add a "Who We Serve" section (couples, groups, business travelers, etc.)
Priority 4: Add Trust Signals
Add a "Featured In" section with logos (local Tel Aviv publications, food blogs)
Make testimonials more detailed with longer quotes and context
Add a photo of Sydney (the founder) to build personal connection
Priority 5: Improve Visual Hierarchy
Make section headings larger and more bold
Add decorative underlines to section headers (using your accent color)
Increase spacing between major sections
Use your gradient more strategically as section dividers
